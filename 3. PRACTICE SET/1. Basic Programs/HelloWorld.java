                            TERMINOLOGY

  CLASS : keyword is used to declare a class in Java.

  PUBLIC : keyword is an access modifier that represents visibility. It means it is visible to all.

  STATIC : If we declare any method (function) as static, it is known as the static method.
            The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object
            to invoke the static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't
             require creating an object to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.

  VOID :  is the return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.

  MAIN :  represents the starting point of the program. ie; First function.

  String[] args : is used for command line argument. args is just a name.

  System.out.println() : is used to print statement to console.
                           Here, System is a class,
                                 out is an object of the PrintStream class,
                                 println() is a method of the PrintStream class.

  PACKAGE : a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
                 Basically a group of similar files
